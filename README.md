# usergt

[API](./API.md)

User management logic: create, destroy, read, authenticate, brute force attack protection, lockout.
Depends on: [Rethinkdb](https://rethinkdb.com/), [Penseur](https://github.com/hueniverse/penseur)

### Brute force protection:

* bcrypt password hashing
  > Introduces a work factor, which determines how expensive the hash function will be.
  > Because of this, bcrypt can keep up with Mooreâ€™s law. As computers get faster you can increase
  > the work factor and the hash will get slower.
  See: [How to safely store a password](https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password)
  for more about storing and authenticating passwords with bcrypt.
* Account Locking<br/>
  After ten failed attempts on an existing account, lock the users account for 24 hours.

### User record validation

Implements Joi to validate userRecords are valid structure (create, authenticate).
authenticate filters out invalid username and passwords to avoid the database read.

###  Basic RBAC (Role Based Accessed Controls)

User objects have a `scope` key.
The scope key is an array of labels. For example, `['admin', 'user']`.
